            The 2021 album made by Golemm features fast-paced hard hitting and most especially funky beats
            quickly establishing the tone of the album. It's first song "Watch out for Golem." introduces 
            us with a build up before its dropping the listener to its catchy and gritty beat. This type of music
            if reflective of the 90s and early 2000s music scene, often racing games at that time were utilizing EDM and similar rave music
            to its soundtrack. If you're interested to learn more about the making of each song, the artist has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2CE3kvkaq6P04yzjtISRrw">YouTube Channel</a> 
            that shows the process on how his songs were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgJvSWvK4Yg&t=46s">made</a>.

          <h5 class="card-title">Requiem (New Mix) by Kashiwa Daisuke</h5>
          <p class="card-text">
            In classical music, there is a structure to be followed, a story the music tries to convey. This is why they use dynamics
            such as crescendo and decrescendo to develop a sense of build up. In Kashiwa Daisuke's song Requiem, we are introduced into a solemn greeting before being brutally thrust in what I describe as chaotic and heavy crescendo of electronic instrumentals paired with orchestral vocals and motifs. Sharing the same semblance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauren_Bousfield">Lauren Bousfield</a> Kashiwa incorporated the same choppy vocals to create an unnerving atmosphere surrounding the song. What we thought as the crescendo of the song is quickly destroyed in the 1:41 mark when the song is once again put into another action packed  build up. We are given a short break with a piano melody before slapping bass and anarchic drums play. An electronic guilar lead soon follows where the song finally reaches its true climax of mashing choppy orchestral vocals, solemn piano melody, brutal beats, and finally electronic glitch sounds. I like this song that despite the chaos and noise its produce, there is still a coherent and solemn melody that I still find. This could be a reason why I like similar musical genres such as breakcore, despite the noisy drum beats a complementary melody is still heard to juxtapose all the noise.

          <h5 class="card-title">Zapper (2021)</h5>
          <p class="card-text">
            Describing nanoray's 2021 album Zapper as simply high energy rave music does it disservice with the execution and what each song brings to the album. Incorporating other elements of different EDM genre such as hardcore and breakbeat, it manages to bring its high energy in different ways. Usage of detune chords in NEKOMATA'97 really reminds me Square Pusher's Number Lucent <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81DpudXtg3g&list=PLE26E0068E057257D">album </a> and Bomberman Hero's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQ-DJd-57Lo">soundtrack </a>. Shows that these types of sounds can be used no matter the era the songs are produced.
